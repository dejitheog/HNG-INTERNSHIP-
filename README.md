#  HNG Internship - Profile Card (Stage 0 Task)

This is my project submission for the **Frontend Wizards Stage 0** task for the **HNG Internship**.  
Itâ€™s a responsive, accessible profile card built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## The profile card displays key personal information, including:

Name

Short biography

Current time in milliseconds (auto-updating)

Avatar image

Social media links

Lists of hobbies and dislikes

Each visible element includes a data-testid attribute for automated testing and validation.
